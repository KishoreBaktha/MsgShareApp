# MsgShareApp
Kotlin
This app was built using Kotlin as part of my interest in learning Kotlin owing to the wide features it provides. This app
provides a screen where the user can enter ant message and the message can be sent directly via email or using some other app 
available in your device to some other person. 
The concept of implicit intent is demonstrated.
Also, the app uses recyclerview to display the hobbies of the user where each hobby is clickable.
